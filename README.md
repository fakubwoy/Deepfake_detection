Welcome to the Deepfake Detection repository! This project aims to detect and report deepfake videos using a combination of MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) and Inception ResNet architecture. Additionally, the model has been fine-tuned on a dataset from FaceForensics to enhance its performance.

## Features

- Web-based Deepfake Detection and Reporting Page
- Jupyter Notebook code for deepfake detection using MTCNN and Inception ResNet
- Model fine-tuned on FaceForensics dataset

## Usage

### Web-based Deepfake Detection and Reporting Page

Visit the [Deepfake Detection Webpage](#) to upload and analyze videos for deepfake content. Follow the intuitive user interface to receive detection results and report potential deepfakes.

### Jupyter Notebook Code

The `deepfake_detection.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains the code for deepfake detection. Follow these steps to run the notebook:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-usernameDeepfake_detection.git
cd deepfake-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open and run the `deepfake_detection.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter. The notebook provides detailed steps for using the MTCNN and Inception ResNet models to detect deepfakes.

## Dataset

The model has been trained on the FaceForensics dataset, a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for deepfake detection research. For more information about the dataset, visit [FaceForensics](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics).
